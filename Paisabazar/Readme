Project Summary - This project builds a machine learning model to predict credit scores (Good, Standard, Poor) using financial and behavioral data from 100,000 customers. After cleaning and encoding the dataset, a Random Forest Classifier is trained to classify credit scores based on features like income, loan history, payment behaviour, and credit utilization. The model is evaluated using accuracy and classification reports, and feature importance is visualized to highlight key factors influencing creditworthiness. This solution can support financial institutions in automated credit risk assessment.
